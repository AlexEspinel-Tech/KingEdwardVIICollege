    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p class="about-bg">King Edward VII College was established in 2010. The College is based in the Melbourne Central Business District (CBD) and offers a diverse range of nationally accredited courses in management, marketing, human resources, and international business. Over the years, it has built a strong reputation for delivering high-quality education that combines theory with practical, industry-relevant skills.

Currently, the College has approximately 500 students enrolled across all programs, representing a multicultural community of learners from Australia and abroad. Its modern facilities, experienced trainers, and supportive academic environment have made it a preferred choice for students seeking to advance their professional careers.

<br>King Edward VII College is well known for its competitive pricing structure, innovative teaching methods, and commitment to continuous improvement. These factors contribute to strong student satisfaction and successful graduate outcomes.

As part of its strategic expansion, the College plans to establish two additional campuses—one in Brisbane and another in Sydney—within the next six months. This growth reflects the institution’s ongoing mission to make quality education accessible to more students across Australia, while maintaining its core values of innovation, learning, and leadership.
